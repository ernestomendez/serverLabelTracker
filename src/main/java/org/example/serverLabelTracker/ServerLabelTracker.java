/**
 * Server Label Tracker
 *
 * Physical servers used by our project are labeled using printed labels,
 * with exactly one label  being attached to a server at any given time.
 * Each label consists of an alphabetic host type (e.g. "apibox") concatenated with the server number,
 * with server numbers allocated sequentially (so, the first label will be "apibox:1", next one "apibox:2", etc).
 * As servers are provisioned and deprovisioned, the labels get attached and detached;
 * detached labels can later be reused for the same host type. We would like to keep the total number
 * of labels printed to a minimum (weâ€™re environmentally friendly!).
 * We would also like to maintain sequential numbering to the extent possible,
 * so when we need a label, we always pick the one with the lowest number.
 *
 * Your task is to write a label tracking class with two operations, "attach(hostType)" and "detach(label)".
 * The former should return the next label to use, while the latter should return the label back into the pool.
